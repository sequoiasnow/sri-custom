The most important part to keep in mind is that images and videos use an enormous amount of bandwidth to both upload and download. The less contact these files have with the network, the less likely it will be that the network is overused. This begins with no streaming of video from any sources for entertainment purposes. Should you wish to stream data for educational purposes either to or from a source, please let the team know to set up a proper time for such usage."
